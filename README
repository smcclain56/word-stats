This is the README FILE for the first homework. 
@Author Sarah McClain

This project takes strings inputted by the user and gives the user options to calculate 
statistics on the string. These options include:

Enter 1 to print vowel and consonant frequency. 
Enter 2 to print word count.
Enter 3 to print histogram.
Enter 4 to return to inputting more strings.
Enter 5 to quit. 

Note: I didn't really understand how to use the struct properly and how to update the histogram on there in particular 
Also I have a makefile (it wasn't working) and seperated my code in the files but I put all of my code in the main file 
so you can run it with a gcc -Wall -g -o main main.c command.
